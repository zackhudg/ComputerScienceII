# ComputerScienceII

This code shows completed assignments for my Computer Science II class in the Spring of 2019. This course provided a general overview of many skills and concepts for CS and programming, such as threading, networking via sockets, and design patterns.

Most files consist of starter code, provided by the professor, which was then edited, added to, or fixed by me for the assignment.
